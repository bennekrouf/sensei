      v1:
        template: |
          Given this reference sentence: '{input_sentence}'
          Compare it to these possible actions and identify which one most closely matches the core intent and meaning of the reference sentence:
          {actions_list}
          Determine the closest match by:
          1. Identifying the main verb/action in the reference sentence
          2. Extracting key elements (who, what, when, where, why, how)
          3. Comparing these elements to the fundamental purpose of each action option
          4. Selecting the action that best captures the essential meaning and purpose
          IMPORTANT: Output only the exact text of the single best matching action from the list.
          DO NOT use any markdown formatting or code blocks.
          DO NOT add any additional text or explanations.
          DO NOT wrap the response in quotes or backticks.

        template: |
          Given these input fields from a sentence: '{input_fields}'\n\
          And these endpoint parameters:\n{parameters}\n\n\
          For each endpoint parameter:\n\
          1. Look at the input fields\n\
          2. Find any field that matches the parameter or its alternatives\n\
          3. Extract the actual value from the matching input field\n\n\
          Return a JSON where:\n\
          - Keys are the endpoint parameter names\n\
          - Values are the actual values found in the input fields\n\
          Only include parameters where you found a matching value.\n\
          Return valid JSON only, no additional text.

  sentence_to_json:
    versions:
      v1:
        template: |
          Sentence: {sentence}
          Task: Generate a precise, minimal JSON structure based strictly on the sentence.
          Rules:
          1. Create an 'endpoints' array with exactly the details from the sentence.
          2. Each endpoint must have:
             - Precise 'description' matching the sentence
             - 'fields' object where EACH key has its EXACT value from the sentence
          3. Do NOT invent additional endpoints or fields
          4. Generate only plain field with its value and not a value a field value as field and a boolean nested in
          5. Use the EXACT values found in the sentence for each field
          6. Output ONLY the valid JSON without ANY introduction sentence like here is the json
          7. Output ONLY the valid JSON without ANY explanation after outputing the json
          8. NEVER include trailing commas in the JSON output
          9. For single field objects, format like: {"field": "value"}          Example input: 'Send email to Alice at alice@example.com which title is New report and body is Hi Alice, here is the new report'
          Example output:
          Raw JSON string: {
            "endpoints": [
              {
                "id": "send_email",
                "description": "Server Down",
                "fields": {
                  "to": "alice@example.com",

          Task: Generate a precise, minimal JSON structure based strictly on the sentence.
          Rules:
          1. Create an 'endpoints' array containing ALL relevant endpoints found in the sentence
          2. Each endpoint in the array must have:
             - Precise 'description' matching the relevant part of the sentence
             - 'fields' object where EACH key has its EXACT value from the sentence
          3. Do NOT invent additional fields or values
          4. Generate only plain field with its value and not a value a field value as field and a boolean nested in
          5. Use the EXACT values found in the sentence for each field
          6. Output ONLY the valid JSON without ANY introduction sentence like here is the json

          8. NEVER include trailing commas in the JSON output
          9. For single field objects, format like: {"field": "value"}
          Example input: 'Send email to Alice at alice@example.com which title is New report and body is Hi Alice, here is the new report. Also schedule a meeting with her tomorrow at 2pm'
          Example output:
